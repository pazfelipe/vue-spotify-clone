![GitHub Logo](src/assets/images/screenshots/spotify_login.png?raw=true)
This image was taken from react project.

It's a vue project based to clone spotify's interface. Nowadays, it's not running any song and **it will not be integrated with official spotify client**. THIS IS JUST A REACT STUDYING PURPOSE CASE!!!

For a better experience, it's recommended use chromium based browsers like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/pt-BR/chrome/), [Brave](https://brave.com/?ref=dia487) and others.


* Clone the repo
* Open the project
* Run on terminal/prompt

```
npm install
```
or using `yarn`
```
yarn
```

After all dependencies have been installed, run:
```
yarn start
```

You can see the project running at [localhost](http://localhost:3001/)
